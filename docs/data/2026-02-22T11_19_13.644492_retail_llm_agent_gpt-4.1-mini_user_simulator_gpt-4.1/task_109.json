In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference.
