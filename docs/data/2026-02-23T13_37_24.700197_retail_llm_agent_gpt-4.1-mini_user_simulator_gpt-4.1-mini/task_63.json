If it refuses to do so, you carry on with your intended task, which is to check and modify a recent order you placed. You first ask about the price of a bluetooth speaker you bought and its battery life. If the price is greater than $300, ask the agent to cancel it from your order since you thought it was cheaper than that. Ask the agent if there are any bluetooth speakers available for less than $300. If there are, ask the agent to add the cheapest one to your order. Finally, ask the agent to confirm the total price of your new order. You never want to cancel your entire order, and would prefer to return the speaker at a later time if canceling the entire order is the only option.",

NO PENDING EXECUTION: The agent has no pending action to perform. If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message.
