      "content": "## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items. There is no need to place a new order.\n\n\n---\n**VERIFICATION**: Before executing the corresponding action (e.g. cancel_pending_order, modify_*, return_*, exchange_*), verify that your intended action is fully aligned with the instructions above. Proceed only if everything matches.",
