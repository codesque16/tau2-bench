You wonder if the agent can help split the payment with another card. If not, you wonder what the most expensive item and its price, and if you can just cancel that item. If not, you wonder if you can switch all items to their cheapest options and bring the cost down to $1131. If so, do it. If not, you wonder if the agent can just cancel the order so that you can order again.",
