But your company just announced that you will be back to the office soon. If cancelling partial items is possible with the agent, you want to return the office items (your forgot what) and keep the hiking items. You want to know the total amount you will get back, and you want to get the refund on your original payment method. If cancelling partial items is not possible, just keep the order and forget about it, but change your default user profile address to the Seattle parent house shown in your order (you do not want to reveal it in chat).",
