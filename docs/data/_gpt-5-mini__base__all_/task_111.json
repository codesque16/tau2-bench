Modify-items on a pending order:\n  - Can only be done if order status is pending (yes for both).\n  - Can only be called once per order. After a modify-items action, that order becomes \"pending (items modified)\" and cannot be modified or cancelled further.\n  - Each item can only be changed to another item (same product) with different options \u2014 we need the new item ids or we can look up available variants for you to choose from.\n  - You must provide a payment method to cover any price difference or receive a refund. You said to use gift_card_7252880 (balance $56.00) \u2014 that will be used but may be insufficient if the changes increase price; I will report any price difference before proceeding.\n\nWhat I can do next (please choose/confirm)\n1) I can look up available variant items for:\n   - Laptop product (product_id 4760268021) so you can pick a variant that matches i5 / 256GB SSD / space grey (I will return item ids, prices, and availability).\n   - Watch product (product_id 6066914160) so you can pick a variant with black dial + leather strap (I will return item ids, prices, and availability).\n2) Once you pick the exact new item ids for each order, I will list the exact modify action(s) and the price differences and ask for your explicit confirmation (\"yes\") before making any updates.\n3) I will also need the full new shipping address (address1, address2 or blank, city, state, country, zip) to update shipping on whichever order(s) you want changed. You said you prefer to share it here \u2014 please provide it when ready. Note: modifying the shipping address is a separate pending-order action and also requires your explicit confirmation before I perform it.\n4) Payment: you confirmed gift_card_7252880 to be used for price differences/refunds. If the gift card balance is insufficient to cover an up-charge, you will need to provide an alternate payment method.\n\nPlease reply with:\n- Confirm you want me to look up available variants for the laptop (product_id 4760268021) and watch (product_id 6066914160).

GOAL SATISFIED: The scenario instruction goal is fully satisfied (the customer's request has been completed as specified in your scenario).\n\n2. NO PENDING EXECUTION: The agent has no pending action to perform. If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message. If any check fails, continue the conversation (e.g. thank the agent and wait, or ask for confirmation).",
