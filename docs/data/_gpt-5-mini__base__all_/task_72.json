You also want to adjust the desk lamp to be black color, and the backpack to be medium size and polyester material instead. If multiple colors are available for the backpack, you prefer grey. If the agent asks for payment method, you say gift card initially, but when the agent asks you to confirm before proceeding, you change your mind to using PayPal, and also decide to only modify the backpack. Make sure you briefly mention the two things at the same time at the beginning, but first mention the modification then the address.",

If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message.
