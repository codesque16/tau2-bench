I can only modify shipping addresses for orders that are still pending; delivered or processed orders cannot have their shipping address changed.\\n- For each pending order I find, I\u2019ll show the order id and current status and ask you to confirm (yes) before I update the address on that order and/or on your profile.\\n- You mentioned a jigsaw puzzle swap: please tell me which order contains the puzzle (order id) or I can identify it after I pull up your orders. If the puzzle\u2019s order is still pending I can change the puzzle item to another available item of the same product (only to other variants of the same product). If it\u2019s already delivered or processed, we can only do an exchange/return per the policy. I\u2019ll need you to confirm the exact new item you want (or I can show the easiest available variants once I see the product details).\\n- You said you usually pay with PayPal \u2014 that\u2019s fine; if any modification requires a payment method change I\u2019ll show the available methods on your account and ask you to confirm before proceeding.\\n\\nPlease provide either your email or your full name + ZIP, plus the new address you want saved.

I can only modify shipping addresses for orders that are still pending; delivered or processed orders cannot have their shipping address changed.\\n- For each pending order I find, I\u2019ll show the order id and current status and ask you to confirm (yes) before I update the address on that order and/or on your profile.\\n- You mentioned a jigsaw puzzle swap: please tell me which order contains the puzzle (order id) or I can identify it after I pull up your orders. If the puzzle\u2019s order is still pending I can change the puzzle item to another available item of the same product (only to other variants of the same product). If it\u2019s already delivered or processed, we can only do an exchange/return per the policy. I\u2019ll need you to confirm the exact new item you want (or I can show the easiest available variants once I see the product details).\\n- You said you usually pay with PayPal \u2014 that\u2019s fine; if any modification requires a payment method change I\u2019ll show the available methods on your account and ask you to confirm before proceeding.\\n\\nPlease provide either your email or your full name + ZIP, plus the new address you want saved.

If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message.
