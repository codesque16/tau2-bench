After modification the order status becomes \"pending (items modified)\" and cannot be modified or cancelled through this system again.\n- For each order I need you to explicitly confirm the action and provide the payment method id to receive the refunds (or to pay, if there were an extra charge). Options:\n  - Use the original payment method (gift_card_7252880). If you choose this gift card, the refunds will be added to it immediately. Your current gift card balance ($56) is less than the total refund amount \u2014 that\u2019s fine for receiving refunds; if any change required payment you\u2019d need to provide a different payment method with sufficient funds.\n  - Or provide a different payment method id (credit_card_xxx or paypal_xxx) you want used to receive the refund.\n- Address change: I will set order #W3730488 shipping address to the NYC address shown above if you confirm. If that is not the correct NYC address, provide the address you prefer.\n- I will perform both item-modification actions separately (one per order). I will list the final modification summary and ask for a final \"yes\" before executing each modification.\n\nPlease reply with:\n1) A single confirmation to proceed with locating and preparing the modifications (reply \"yes\" to proceed).\n2) For order #W3730488 (laptop): confirm you want to change to item 9844888101 and to use the NYC address 555 Highland Drive, Suite 872, New York, NY 10116, USA (or supply a different NYC address).\n3) For order #W9810810 (watch): confirm you want to change the watch to item 9949163720 (black dial, leather strap).\n4) Payment method id to receive the refunds for both changes (e.g., gift_card_7252880 or another payment method id).\n\nOnce you reply with those confirmations (and \u201cyes\u201d), I will present the final action summaries and ask you to explicitly confirm each modification before I call the update tools.",
