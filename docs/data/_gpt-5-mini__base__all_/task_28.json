Please provide either (A) the email on your account, or (B) your first name, last name, and zip code so I can look up your user id. Also tell me: 1) The order id for the recent order that was delivered (the one you want to return skateboard, garden hose, backpack, keyboard, and bed from). 2) The order id for the pending order that contains the garden hose you want canceled. If those items are split across orders, please specify which items are in which order. \\n\\nA few important notes before we proceed:\\n- I must locate your user id first (by email or name+zip) before I can look up orders.  \\n- Returns can only be done on orders with status \\\"delivered\\\". I will need you to confirm the delivered order id and the list of item ids (or confirm the item names from that order) before creating a return request. You must also provide the payment method to receive the refund (original payment method or an existing gift card). After you confirm the return details I will ask you to explicitly confirm (yes) before submitting the return.  \\n- For the pending order: we can only cancel an entire pending order. The system does not support canceling a single item within a pending order. If you want only the garden hose removed but the rest of that pending order to remain, that is not possible via cancellation. Alternatives are: cancel the entire pending order, or keep it as-is. If you want to cancel the entire pending order, I will list the cancellation details and ask you to confirm (yes) before proceeding.  \\n- Refund timing: if the original payment was a gift card the refund is immediate to that card; otherwise refunds take 5\u20137 business days. \\n\\nPlease provide: 1) email OR first name + last name + zip, 2) delivered order id, 3) pending order id, and 4) confirm whether you want me to cancel the whole pending order (since single-item cancellation isn\u2019t supported). Also tell me which payment method you'd like refunds issued to (original method or an existing gift card) or tell me to use the original payment method.

I will need you to confirm the delivered order id and the list of item ids (or confirm the item names from that order) before creating a return request.

If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message.
