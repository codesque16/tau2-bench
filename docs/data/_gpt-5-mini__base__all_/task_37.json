We can either:\\n  1) Change the entire order to a different single payment method on your account (you currently have only credit_card_8853416 listed). If you have another payment method to add (PayPal, another card, or a gift card with enough balance), you can add it to your account and ask me to switch the order payment to that single method. I will show the change details and ask for your explicit confirmation before making the change.\\n  2) Cancel the entire order (only possible if status is pending). To cancel I must confirm the order id (#W9348897) and a cancellation reason: either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake'. After you confirm I will proceed and ask for explicit 'yes' before executing the cancellation.\\n  3) Modify items in a pending order is only for swapping items to different variants of the same product (not removing items). This can be done only once per order and requires you to confirm all item changes and a payment method to cover any price difference.\\n\\nWhat would you like to do next? Options:\\n- \\\"Switch payment\\\" \u2014 tell me the payment method id you want to use (must be a single existing method or add a new one first).\\n- \\\"Cancel order\\\" \u2014 I will ask you to confirm the cancellation reason (provide 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') and then confirm to proceed.\\n- \\\"Modify items\\\" \u2014 tell me exactly which items you want swapped to which available item ids (note: only variants of the same product and only one modify call allowed).\\n- \\\"Add payment method\\\" \u2014 tell me the type (gift card/PayPal/credit card) and details, then ask me to switch payment.\\n\\nIf you just want me to cancel the Action Camera specifically, I cannot cancel single items \u2014 you would need to either modify items (swap to a cheaper variant of the same product) or cancel the whole order and reorder. Tell me which option you prefer.\"}",

The most expensive item on that order is:\\n\\n- Action Camera \u2014 item id 6117189161 \u2014 $481.50\\n\\nOrder summary (items and prices):\\n- Action Camera (6117189161): $481.50\\n- Patio Umbrella (9879255677): $288.82\\n- Backpack (9851293632): $193.38\\n- Desk Lamp (7453605304): $150.01\\n- T-Shirt (3799046073): $53.27\\n\\nYour order total is $1,166.98, paid with credit_card_8853416 (Visa ending 6593).\\n\\nImportant notes and next steps I can help with:\\n- I cannot split a single order across two payment methods \u2014 the system only allows one payment method per order.\\n- You cannot cancel a single item from an order using the cancellation tool. We can either:\\n  1) Change the entire order to a different single payment method on your account (you currently have only credit_card_8853416 listed). If you have another payment method to add (PayPal, another card, or a gift card with enough balance), you can add it to your account and ask me to switch the order payment to that single method. I will show the change details and ask for your explicit confirmation before making the change.\\n  2) Cancel the entire order (only possible if status is pending). To cancel I must confirm the order id (#W9348897) and a cancellation reason: either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake'. After you confirm I will proceed and ask for explicit 'yes' before executing the cancellation.\\n  3) Modify items in a pending order is only for swapping items to different variants of the same product (not removing items). This can be done only once per order and requires you to confirm all item changes and a payment method to cover any price difference.\\n\\nWhat would you like to do next? Options:\\n- \\\"Switch payment\\\" \u2014 tell me the payment method id you want to use (must be a single existing method or add a new one first).\\n- \\\"Cancel order\\\" \u2014 I will ask you to confirm the cancellation reason (provide 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') and then confirm to proceed.\\n- \\\"Modify items\\\" \u2014 tell me exactly which items you want swapped to which available item ids (note: only variants of the same product and only one modify call allowed).\\n- \\\"Add payment method\\\" \u2014 tell me the type (gift card/PayPal/credit card) and details, then ask me to switch payment.\\n\\nIf you just want me to cancel the Action Camera specifically, I cannot cancel single items \u2014 you would need to either modify items (swap to a cheaper variant of the same product) or cancel the whole order and reorder. Tell me which option you prefer.\"}",

Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message. If any check fails, continue the conversation (e.g. thank the agent and wait, or ask for confirmation).",
