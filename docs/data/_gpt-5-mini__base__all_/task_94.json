If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message.
