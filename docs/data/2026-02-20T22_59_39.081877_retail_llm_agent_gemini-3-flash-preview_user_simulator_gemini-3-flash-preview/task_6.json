My goal here is to establish similar variant diversity, but I'm thinking about the inherent differences in these products and the implications for variant definition. I'll need to consider material properties, insulation, size, spout design, and maybe even smart features for this product. The key is to extrapolate the methodology. I want to build a reusable framework for variant engineering, not just a one-off solution for each product. This presents a great opportunity to look for efficiencies in my variant engineering process.\n\n\n"
