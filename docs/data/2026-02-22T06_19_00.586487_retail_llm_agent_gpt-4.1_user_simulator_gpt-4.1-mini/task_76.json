Here\u2019s what I found:\n\n1. **Pending Orders:**\n   - You have two pending orders with relevant items:\n     - **Order #W8367380:** Contains a fleece jacket (item id: 8733974883).\n     - **Order #W1242543:** Contains a skateboard (item id: 9594745976) with options: plastic, 34 inch, custom design.\n\n2. **Skateboard Modification:**\n   - You requested a skateboard with maple material, 34 inch size, and a graphic design.\n   - Unfortunately, there is **no available skateboard variant with maple, 34 inch, and graphic design**. The closest maple options are:\n     - Maple, 28 inch, graphic (item id: 2819462352, available)\n     - Maple, 31 inch, graphic (item id: 5120532699, available)\n     - Maple, 34 inch, graphic (**not available**)\n\n3. **Fleece Jacket Removal:**\n   - I can remove the fleece jacket from order #W8367380, or cancel the entire order if you prefer.\n\n4. **Grill Purchases:**\n   - You purchased grills in order #W8668939:\n     - Grill (electric, medium): $985.66\n     - Grill (electric, portable): $953.39\n   - **Total spent on grills:** $1,939.05\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Would you like to:\n  - Remove just the fleece jacket from order #W8367380?\n  - Modify the skateboard in order #W1242543 to one of the available maple options (28 inch or 31 inch, both with graphic design)?\n  - Cancel either or both orders if these changes do not meet your needs?\n\nPlease confirm how you\u2019d like to proceed, and let me know if you want to modify both orders at once or just one.'"
