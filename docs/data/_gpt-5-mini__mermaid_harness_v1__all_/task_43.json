Install the Google Family Link for Parents app from the Play Store on your phone.\n  2. Open Family Link and follow the prompts to create a family group and add your child. If your child doesn\u2019t have a Google account, Family Link can create one.\n  3. Link the child\u2019s Google account to yours during setup. You\u2019ll be asked to sign into the child\u2019s device.\n\n- Steps on the child\u2019s Android tablet\n  1. Factory reset or set up the tablet if it\u2019s new. Connect to Wi\u2011Fi.\n  2. When asked to sign in, sign in with the child Google account you created/linked.\n  3. Install Google Family Link for Children & Teens on the tablet (if prompted).\n  4. Follow prompts to complete the link \u2014 you may need to enter your parent account credentials to approve.\n\n- Key Family Link controls you should configure\n  - App approvals: Require parent approval for new app installs or purchases.\n  - Screen time limits: Set daily limits and a bedtime.\n  - App activity: View app usage and manage which apps are allowed.\n  - Location: Turn on location so you can find the device.\n  - Content filters: Set filters for Google Search, YouTube, and the Play Store by maturity level.\n\n- Additional Android settings\n  - Create a simple home screen: remove Play Store shortcut or limit access to it.\n  - Turn off automatic sign-in to Google services you don't want the child using.\n  - Disable in-app purchases in the Play Store settings or require authentication for purchases.\n  - Install a kid browser or enable SafeSearch on Chrome.\n  - Set up automatic updates in Google Play to keep apps secure.\n\n- Tips for usability\n  - Pin frequently used apps to the home screen.\n  - Increase font size and enable simple launcher if available.\n  - Use parental-control-friendly apps (YouTube Kids, Khan Academy Kids, PBS Kids).\n  - Teach basic gestures and where to find help files in apps.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Walk you through each step interactively for your tablet (tell me whether you have the parental phone and the tablet available now), or\n- Send a checklist you can follow later.\n\nChat \u2014 friendly reply\n- I\u2019m glad to keep you company.
