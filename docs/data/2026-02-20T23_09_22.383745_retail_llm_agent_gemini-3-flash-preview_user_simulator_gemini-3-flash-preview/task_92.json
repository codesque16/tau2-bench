It does mention a one-time rule for exchanges, but nothing specific about returns beyond best practice to do it in one shot, which is fine, but the tool `return_delivered_order_items` only takes one order ID at a time, anyway. I've already explained the return details and received confirmation to proceed. The refunds are definitely going to the original payment method, `credit_card_5902940`.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to proceed. I will call `return_delivered_order_items` for order #W7553978 first. Then, I will call the same tool again for order #W3239882. Wait, hold on. The policy states I should only make one tool call at a time. I will call #W7553978 first, then call #W3239882.\n\n\n"
