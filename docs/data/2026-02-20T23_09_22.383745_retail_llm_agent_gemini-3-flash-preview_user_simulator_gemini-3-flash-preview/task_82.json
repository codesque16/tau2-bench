The original payment method was a gift card, and it can be sent to the gift card.\n\nI need to circle back and confirm this, because I see a conflict.

Yep, `payment_history: [{amount: 4293.43, payment_method_id: \"gift_card_7250692\", transaction_type: \"payment\"}]`. The order was indeed fully paid using the gift card.\n\nAlright.
