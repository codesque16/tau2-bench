It's clear that the Action Camera is the priciest item in this order. That's good to know.\n\nNow, about canceling a single item... I need to check the cancellation policies. I've got the policies for \"Modify pending order\" and \"Cancel pending order\". Aha! It appears the policies state I can modify shipping addresses, payment methods, or item options if the order is pending, but there is nothing on removing items. I can only cancel the whole order if it's pending. There isn't even a tool to change my mind and remove just one item, like `modify_pending_order_items`, which is only for changing options of the same item. Well, that\u2019s not exactly what the user was hoping for, I imagine.

Unfortunately, even with the cheapest available variants for every item, the total remains above your $950 limit.\n\nSince I cannot cancel individual items or reach that target total by switching options, would you like to:\n1.  Proceed with these modifications anyway?\n2.  Cancel the entire order so you can place a new one with fewer items?\n3.  Keep the order as it is?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed. If you choose to modify the items, I'll also need you to confirm the payment method to use for the price difference (your current Visa card ending in 6593 or another method).",
