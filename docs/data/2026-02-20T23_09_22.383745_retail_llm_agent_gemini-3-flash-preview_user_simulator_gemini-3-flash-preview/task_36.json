Now, my next step is clear. I need to retrieve all the pertinent details associated with this user ID. Specifically, I'm thinking I'll need to fetch their order history to understand their past interactions with the system, and crucially, I need to know the payment methods they've used or have on file. This will inform whatever task is at hand, be it order fulfillment, analysis of purchasing behavior, or something else entirely. It's the standard procedure to access that user data from the database, likely using the ID as the key.\n\n\n"

Yep, too high.\n\nThe next step is to get the product details for each of these items using the product IDs. I'll need that `get_product_details` function called for each of those product IDs. This is where I'll find all the available variants and their prices for each product. Once I have that information, I'll be able to identify the cheapest option for each one and recalculate the order total. Let's start with getting the details...\n\n\n",
