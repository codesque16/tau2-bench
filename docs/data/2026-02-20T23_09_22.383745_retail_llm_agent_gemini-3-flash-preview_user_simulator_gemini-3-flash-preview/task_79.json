The 1000ml bottle from that order is item `1434748144` (Red, Glass). Here's where it gets interesting: the inventory says that exact item, `1434748144`, is currently *unavailable*. Hmm, that's odd, since they just ordered it. It's possible the stock status updated very recently.\n\nMy initial thought was to simply swap them, but since `1434748144` is unavailable, that's not possible. I need to offer alternatives. I quickly checked for other 1000ml bottles and found two options:\n\n*   `2439754078`: 1000ml, Red, Stainless Steel ($49.51)\n*   `7661609223`: 1000ml, Black, Stainless Steel ($46.51)\n\nI re-read the user's request. They said, \"I actually just placed another order for a 1000ml bottle, and I'd like to change the small one to match the 1000ml one instead.\" Okay, that clarifies things. She wants the 500ml bottle to be replaced with something equivalent to the 1000ml order in `#W9284598`. Even though I know the exact match isn't in stock, that's the reference point. I should offer the closest matches.\n\nBefore doing anything, I double-checked the inventory for `1434748144` again, just to be sure, and confirmed it's still marked as unavailable. I *definitely* can't change the order to include an out-of-stock item. I should explain this to the user immediately.\n\nOrder `#W8661412` is *pending*, so it *can* be modified, good. Item `3453331371` is the one to be swapped, and my goal is to find a suitable 1000ml replacement. The stainless steel options seem reasonable.\n\nI'll revisit the choices again:\n\n*   `2439754078`: 1000ml, Red, Stainless Steel ($49.51)\n*   `7661609223`: 1000ml, Black, Stainless Steel ($46.51)\n\nThe original item, `3453331371`, is listed at $52.79. I'll need to factor in the price difference: a refund will need to be calculated and given.\n\nI am ready to explain the situation to the user and present the available options.\n\n\n",
