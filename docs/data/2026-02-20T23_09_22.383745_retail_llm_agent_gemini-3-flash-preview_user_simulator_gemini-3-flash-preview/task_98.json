Jigsaw Puzzle in the same order also needs to be exchanged, you want the same difficulty, but 1000 more pieces, and you prefer animal than art theme if both are available. Make sure you mention these at the same time.  You also want to exchange your camera to a slightly lower resolution, without changing the other options. If the agent asks for confirmation, mention that you'd prefer the other card as payment or refund method. Lastly, you want to cancel the skateboard in your other order.",
