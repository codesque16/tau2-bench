There's also a return for a Smart Watch (item_id: 2554056026) from order #W9389413. The refund for that needs to go back to the original PayPal payment method.\n\nBefore I do anything, I should confirm the numbers. Looks like the refunds break down like this: $3131.10 for #W5199551, $4777.75 for #W8665881, and $367.38 for the Smart Watch return, which totals $8276.23.\n\nNow, based on the documented workflow, I need to call the appropriate functions. I'll need to use `cancel_pending_order` for both of those pending orders, using the reason 'no longer needed'. Then, I will call `return_delivered_order_items` for order #W9389413, specifying the item ID as 2554056026, and referencing the payment_method_id 'paypal_5364164'.\n\nRight, I just need to remember to adhere to policy.
