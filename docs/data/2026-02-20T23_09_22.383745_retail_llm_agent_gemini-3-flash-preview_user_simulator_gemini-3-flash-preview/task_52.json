The customer wants to swap out the current camera, item ID `5996159312` which is a 24MP, SD card, 3x zoom model, and trade it for something with a bit more reach. They want to stick with the SD card format.\n\nI've checked the product variants for the 10x zoom models, specifically product ID `8940227892`. The closest match, and the only one currently available, is item ID `9228757377`. This is a 30MP, SD card, 10x zoom camera. It satisfies the user's specific request for maximum zoom while keeping the SD card storage. That's the one.\n\nNow, for the details. I need to calculate the price difference, which is $3066.23 (new camera) minus $2895.55 (current camera), totaling $170.68.

The exchange adheres to the \"Exchange delivered order\" policy: the order is marked as 'delivered', the user has confirmed this item for exchange, both items are indeed digital cameras, and the user has provided a payment method.\n\nSo, here's the plan: I'll inform the user about the exchange details and get explicit confirmation.
