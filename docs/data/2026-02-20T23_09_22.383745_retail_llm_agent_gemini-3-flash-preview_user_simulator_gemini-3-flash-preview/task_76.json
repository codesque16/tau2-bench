I can't swap a shirt for a shoe, but could I swap a blue jacket for a red one? Still, that's not what the user wants. They want to eliminate it entirely.\n\nHmm, if I can't remove a *single* item, can I cancel the *entire* order? The policy says \"An order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending'...

I checked the inventory for the **maple, 34-inch, graphic** version you requested, but unfortunately, that specific combination is currently **out of stock**.\n\nHowever, I do have these similar options available:\n*   **Maple, 31-inch, graphic** ($187.23)\n*   **Bamboo, 34-inch, graphic** ($193.79)\n*   **Plastic, 34-inch, graphic** ($187.71)\n\nWould you like to modify your skateboard order to one of these available options, or would you prefer to just proceed with the cancellation of the first order for now? \n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed, and once you confirm, I'll take care of it!",

That's straightforward; I can confirm those details.\n\nNow, focusing back on the skateboard modification, I can see that the existing order (W1242543) currently contains a plastic, custom, 34-inch skateboard. The *requested* change involves a material and graphic change, to maple and graphic which is not available as a 34 inch option. Since the specific variant they requested is out of stock, I'm not going to immediately give up. I should at least check for alternatives.\n\nLet's see\u2026 I've got some other similar variants available.

Finally, I found a plastic option at 34 inch (item 5489028872).\n\nTherefore, my response will need to cover all of these bases. I need to:\n\n1.

And for #W1242543, it's pretty clear I don't need it since I mentioned I don't need the \"other version,\" which I'm assuming the system understands from the context. So, I need to call `cancel_pending_order` for each of them.\n\nNow, I remember the policy, only one tool call at a time. So, first, I will execute the tool call for the first order to be cancelled, #W8367380. I'll make sure to get that one done and process the result before tackling the second order.\n\n\n"
