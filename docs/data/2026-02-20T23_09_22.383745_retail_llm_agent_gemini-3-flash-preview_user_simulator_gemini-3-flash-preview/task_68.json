The problem is, I've completely blanked on what email I used for it. I know I used my name, Noah Ito, and my zip code is 98178. Right, so I have to authenticate first. According to the standard protocol, I *must* authenticate the user by locating their user ID. That usually requires either the email address directly, or a combination of name and zip code. Since I don\u2019t have my email, I need to go with the name and zip code option. Let's see... I'll need to use the `find_user_id_by_name_zip` tool to get the process started.
