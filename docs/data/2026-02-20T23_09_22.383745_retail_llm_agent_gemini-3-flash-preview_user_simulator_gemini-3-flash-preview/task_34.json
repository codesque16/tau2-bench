I can't remove items from a pending order. I can only cancel the whole order or modify items. The user specifically said they want to \"cancel some of the stuff\".

Good, that's doable \u2013 policy allows modifications for pending orders, which this one is. I need to run through a quick checklist in my head. First, double-check that the order status is *actually* pending. Yep, confirmed. Now, it's about getting the new address, explaining the change, and then getting explicit confirmation.\n\nThe user asked about the \"New York address.\"  That's where the nuance comes in. Do they want a *different* NYC address, or did they mean their existing default? I need to clarify that. Wait, they *did* just say \"Can we change the shipping address to my place here in NYC?\". Hmmm, I have their default address already from `get_user_details`, which is 224 Elm Street, Suite 491, New York, NY 10108, USA.\n\nAlright, here's the plan. I'll propose using *that* address. It's the most efficient route. I'll start by informing the user that I *can* change the address. Then, I'll propose their default address. Finally, I'll clearly explain that once they confirm, the address for order #W1845024 will be updated, and ask for a simple yes/no response.

Good, that's doable \u2013 policy allows modifications for pending orders, which this one is. I need to run through a quick checklist in my head. First, double-check that the order status is *actually* pending. Yep, confirmed. Now, it's about getting the new address, explaining the change, and then getting explicit confirmation.\n\nThe user asked about the \"New York address.\"  That's where the nuance comes in. Do they want a *different* NYC address, or did they mean their existing default? I need to clarify that. Wait, they *did* just say \"Can we change the shipping address to my place here in NYC?\". Hmmm, I have their default address already from `get_user_details`, which is 224 Elm Street, Suite 491, New York, NY 10108, USA.\n\nAlright, here's the plan. I'll propose using *that* address. It's the most efficient route. I'll start by informing the user that I *can* change the address. Then, I'll propose their default address. Finally, I'll clearly explain that once they confirm, the address for order #W1845024 will be updated, and ask for a simple yes/no response. This avoids ambiguity and ensures we're on the same page.\n\n\n"
