Now, the goal is to find the *cheapest* t-shirt available. That's a classic problem. To get started, I need to know the specific product ID for \"t-shirt\". I could hard-code it, but that's a recipe for future problems if the catalog changes. Better to query the system dynamically. So, I'll call `list_all_product_types`. That should give me the product ID I need to formulate the right search query to find the least expensive t-shirt. It is going to be a straightforward call, nothing complicated or unusual. Should take only a moment.\n\n\n"
