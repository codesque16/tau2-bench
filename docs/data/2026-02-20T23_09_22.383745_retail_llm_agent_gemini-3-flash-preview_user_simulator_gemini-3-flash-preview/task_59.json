You'll first inquire about the status difference between your two orders, #W2702727 and #W8268610, since both are \"pending,\" but one was placed much earlier in the year. You are considering cancelling the older order as you find the wait time unreasonable. If the agent cannot guarantee the older order will be processed within 5 days, you want to cancel it. You also want to confirm the total price of the refund. \n\n    For order #W2702727, you intend to switch the shipping address to your new home in a different city because you plan to move prior to its delivery next month. Your new address is 1234 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701. You want the agent to confirm the change and ensure the order will be delivered to the new address. You also want to confirm the total price of the order after the address change.",
