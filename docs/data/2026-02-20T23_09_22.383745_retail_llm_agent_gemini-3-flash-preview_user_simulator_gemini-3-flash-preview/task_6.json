We'll be looking at all potential variants, taking into account materials, capacities, features (like insulation, spout types, built-in filters), aesthetics (colors, finishes, shapes), and manufacturing processes. It is important to remember that these aspects will require different expertise and considerations for successful implementation. It is important to know the aspects that require external consultants to bring expertise where it is needed. We need to be exhaustive here, even considering seemingly minor details \u2013 because often, those seemingly minor details are what create significant market segmentation and competitive advantages. The goal is to build a comprehensive variant matrix for the Water Bottle, ensuring that we've captured the full range of possibilities. This process is crucial to informed decisions around product development, marketing, and inventory management.\n\n\n"
