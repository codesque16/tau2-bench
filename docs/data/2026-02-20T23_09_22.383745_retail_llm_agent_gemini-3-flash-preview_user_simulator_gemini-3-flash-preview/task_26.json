Let's break this down systematically. My first priority is always **authentication**. I'll need to verify who this user is to ensure I'm accessing the correct information and fulfilling their request securely. I'll probably start by asking for some basic identifying information like their email address or maybe their name and zip code, something readily available but specific enough for a preliminary match in the database.\n\nOnce I've got that initial confirmation, the next step is to **locate the relevant order**. I'll need to query our order database using the authenticated user's credentials to identify all orders associated with them. Then, I'll filter that list to isolate the specific order that was sent to Texas, as that's the one they're interested in.\n\nNow comes the crucial part: **checking the order's status**. Returns are typically only processed for orders that have been successfully *delivered*. So, before going any further, I'll examine the order's tracking information to ensure that it has reached the \"delivered\" status. If not, I'll need to inform the user that a return is not possible yet and provide any available shipping updates.\n\nNext, I'll focus on **identifying the items within the order**. I need to create a list of the contents in order to exclude the pet bed from the return. I'll need to clearly delineate which items will be returned and which one is being kept.\n\nFinally, I'll need to **arrange for a payment method**.
