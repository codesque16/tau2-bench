Once you confirm, I\u2019ll perform the necessary updates.\n\nWhat I plan to do\n- Puzzle order change\n  - Locate the order containing the 1000-piece intermediate jigsaw puzzle.\n  - Change that item to the variant with the fewest pieces available (the easiest option), within the same product type. I will confirm the exact new item before proceeding.\n  - If the order is pending, I\u2019ll update it directly; if it\u2019s already processed, I\u2019ll check if an exchange is possible and explain the options.\n\n- Address check and update\n  - Check the address(es) on your profile and for any pending orders.\n  - If needed, update your default address in your profile.\n  - If there are pending orders with incorrect addresses, I\u2019ll propose updating those addresses and confirm before making changes.\n\nInformation I need from you\n1) Identity verification\n- Please provide one of the following to locate your account:\n  - Your account email, or\n  - Your full name (as registered) and ZIP code\n\n2) Puzzle order details\n- The order ID that contains the 1000-piece intermediate jigsaw puzzle (or the list of recent orders if you\u2019re not sure of the ID).\n- Confirm you want me to replace the 1000-piece puzzle with the easiest variant (fewest pieces) in the same product type.

GOAL SATISFIED: The scenario instruction goal is fully satisfied (the customer's request has been completed as specified in your scenario).\n\n2. NO PENDING EXECUTION: The agent has no pending action to perform. If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete. If you are being transferred to a human, use ###TRANSFER### instead. If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message. If any check fails, continue the conversation (e.g. thank the agent and wait, or ask for confirmation).",
