I can help, but I need to confirm a plan before I make any changes, since we\u2019ll be acting on multiple orders/items.\n\nWhat I understand from you:\n- You want to cancel all pending orders.\n- You want to return all delivered orders (refunds), but you want to keep your boots.\n- You\u2019re open to exchanging the boots for cheaper boots of the same size and material to get some money back.\n\nWhat I need from you to proceed (all in one plan):\n1) Cancellations (pending orders)\n- Please provide the list of order IDs that are currently pending and you want canceled.\n\n2) Returns (delivered orders)\n- Please provide the list of items (order ID + item IDs) that you want returned. If you have many orders, you can give me the list of delivered orders and I\u2019ll determine returnable items, but I\u2019ll need items to return per order.\n\n3) Boots exchange\n- Confirm you want to exchange only the boots in delivered/pending orders for replacement boots that are cheaper, same size and material.\n- Please provide:\n  - The order ID(s) that contain the boots you want to exchange.\n  - The item IDs of the boots you\u2019re exchanging (and the corresponding new item IDs for the replacement boots, in the same positions).\n  - The payment method for any price difference (gift card or credit card). If you\u2019re exchanging because the new boots are cheaper, the difference would be refunded to your original payment method or as a gift card, depending on policy.\n  - If you don\u2019t have exact replacement boot item IDs handy, I can look for cheaper options in the boots category\u2014would you like me to browse and propose suitable replacements that match size and material?\n\n4) Keeping your current boots\n- Just to confirm: you want to keep your current boots you\u2019re not exchanging away, correct? If any boots are part of an exchange, they\u2019ll be swapped for the new, cheaper options; otherwise, you\u2019ll retain them.\n\nNext step\n- If you confirm this plan and provide the lists/IDs above, I\u2019ll gather and present a single consolidated action plan for cancellation, returns, and the boot exchange, then I\u2019ll proceed with the changes in one go (following the \u201cone write action per order\u201d rule by grouping steps per order as needed).\n\nWould you like me to proceed with collecting these details now? If you\u2019d prefer, I can also start by listing all pending orders and delivered orders on your account to help you identify which to cancel/return, then we can fill in the specific IDs.",
