Laptop item ID 2913673670, planned new item ID 2216662955 (i5, 256GB SSD, space grey).\n  - Watch: #W9810810 (pending). Watch item ID 1355937109 (white dial, leather strap); plan to exchange for black dial with leather strap.\n- Executed partial action:\n  - Updated the laptop item to the new variant in the order draft (pending). Display showed a refund line of 181.37 as part of the item change, and status updated to \u201cpending (item modified).\u201d\n- You asked to proceed with all three changes in one batch and have a human agent handle it. I\u2019ve escalated to a human agent to finalize:\n  - Shipping update for #W3730488 to NYC address on file.\n  - Laptop spec change to i5/256GB/space grey with correct new item ID.\n  - Watch exchange to black dial with leather strap, including price difference handling.\n  - No preference for payment method; agent will apply standard process if any difference arises.\n\nWhat I still need from you\n- If the human agent needs any clarification or you want to adjust anything, I\u2019ll pass along immediately.\n\nNext steps\n- A human agent will contact you with a confirmation of all three changes, including any price differences and the exact new item IDs used. They will confirm the final steps and provide any expected timelines.\n\nWould you like me to add a note for the human agent to verify that the NYC address on file is indeed used for the laptop shipping update and to keep the leather strap for the watch exchange as you specified?",

NYC address on file will be used for the laptop shipping update.\n- Identified orders:\n  - Laptop: #W3730488 (pending). Laptop item ID 2913673670, planned new item ID 2216662955 (i5, 256GB SSD, space grey).\n  - Watch: #W9810810 (pending). Watch item ID 1355937109 (white dial, leather strap); plan to exchange for black dial with leather strap.\n- Executed partial action:\n  - Updated the laptop item to the new variant in the order draft (pending). Display showed a refund line of 181.37 as part of the item change, and status updated to \u201cpending (item modified).\u201d\n- You asked to proceed with all three changes in one batch and have a human agent handle it. I\u2019ve escalated to a human agent to finalize:\n  - Shipping update for #W3730488 to NYC address on file.\n  - Laptop spec change to i5/256GB/space grey with correct new item ID.\n  - Watch exchange to black dial with leather strap, including price difference handling.\n  - No preference for payment method; agent will apply standard process if any difference arises.\n\nWhat I still need from you\n- If the human agent needs any clarification or you want to adjust anything, I\u2019ll pass along immediately.\n\nNext steps\n- A human agent will contact you with a confirmation of all three changes, including any price differences and the exact new item IDs used. They will confirm the final steps and provide any expected timelines.\n\nWould you like me to add a note for the human agent to verify that the NYC address on file is indeed used for the laptop shipping update and to keep the leather strap for the watch exchange as you specified?",

If the agent said they would do something (e.g. cancel an order, process a return), wait until they have confirmed it is done or you have seen the outcome. Do not stop while the agent might still be about to execute something.\n\n3. CORRECT TERMINATION TYPE: You are ending because the task is complete.

If the scenario does not provide enough information to continue, use ###OUT-OF-SCOPE### instead.\n\nOnly if all checks pass, output ###STOP### in your next message.
