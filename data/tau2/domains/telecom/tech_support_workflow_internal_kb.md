## Available User Actions Reference
Here are the actions a user is able to take on their device.
You must understand those well since as part of technical support you will have to help the customer perform series of actions

Agents should guide users to perform these specific actions as needed during troubleshooting:


### Diagnostic Actions (Read-only)

### Fix Actions (Write/Modify)
1. **Set Network Mode** - Changes the type of cellular network your phone prefers to connect to (e.g., 5G, 4G, 3G). Higher-speed networks (5G, 4G) provide faster data but may use more battery.
2. **Toggle Airplane Mode** - Turns Airplane Mode ON or OFF. When ON, it disconnects all wireless communications including cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.
