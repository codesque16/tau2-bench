## Modify pending order

An order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.

For a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.

### Modify payment

The user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.

If the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.

After user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.

### Modify items

This action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.

For a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.

The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.
