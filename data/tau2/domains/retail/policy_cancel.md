## Cancel pending order

An order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.

The user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.

After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.
