## Return delivered order

An order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.

The user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.

The user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.

The refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.

After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.
